# Temperatures

## 🛋️ Static Comfort Temperature

The comfort temperature is the temperature that is set when you might be at home or your presence sensor is triggered or your heating schedule is *on*.
This temperature setting serves as a fallback temperature. If a static temperature is sufficient for you and you do not want to adjust it further via the UI, this setting is sufficient.
However, temporal temperature adjustments can be made via the adjustments.

## 🌱 Static Eco Temperature

The eco temperature is the temperature that is set when you are not at home, for example, or your schedule does not prescribe heating to the comfort temperature.
This temperature setting serves as a fallback temperature. If a static temperature is sufficient for you and you do not want to adjust it further via the UI, this setting is sufficient.
However, temporal temperature adjustments can be made via the adjustments.
